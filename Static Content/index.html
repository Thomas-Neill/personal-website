        <p>Hello, and thanks for visiting! This is a website about me, Thomas Neill.
          I program as a hobby, and one day want to be a professional programmer.
          I'm proficent, as my Github shows, in Python, C, C++, and Haskell,
          and as the page you're reading right now shows, I have at least competence in front-end web design.
          I have a few open-source projects you may or may not be interested in.
          I also enjoy JRPGs, board games, and rainy days.</p>
